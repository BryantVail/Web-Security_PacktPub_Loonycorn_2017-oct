    authentication
        know who
        uniquely identify
            associate with the correct account
        clients
        Identity 
    authorization
        know what they can do
        what resources
            what actions 
        priviledges
            read
            read/write
            transfer money in an app
        
    auditing
        audit trail
        did the user actually perform the action? 
        very important
        non-repudiation
            where someone cannot claim an 
            action hasn't been taken

    Confidentiality: 
        is the data safe
        unauthorized users access? 
        AccessControlList (ACLs)
    Integrity: 
        safe from unauthorized users 
        can data only be modified by authorized users? 
        unAuthorized changes
        Hashing
    Availability
        does the system work for legitimate users? 
        crashing the system 
        Denial Of Service
            where the system can't handle intended actions

Security & its building Blocks 

Risk/Exposure: 
    likelihood of being attacked and of the attack 
    surface area
    what is shown to the outside world
    more APIs the more Vulnerable
Threat
    occurrence that can harm your system 
    threat is not always intentional
Vulnerablility
    weakness, 
    insecure 3rd party code 
Attack 
    action which inacts a threat to exploit a vulnerability

What causes Security Vulnerabilities? 
    1. Poorly written code
    2. The size & complexity of your app 
    3. Web Servers are inherently complex and have their own weaknesses
    4. Database Servers: 
        other systems
        further surface area 
    5. Sites have increasing complex interactions with users, with special permissions. 
    6. Lineage of Code

Known & Unknown Vulnerabilities: 
    few hackers find their own vulnerabilities 
    Most Vulnerabilities are: 
        Known: 
            copy-cats spread the awareness of the risk
